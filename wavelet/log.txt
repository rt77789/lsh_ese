LSH=Locality Sensitive Hashing

LSH主要思路：
1. random projection from R^d to R^t. (optional)
2. L hashing function g_i(q) = (h_i(1), h_i(2), ... h_i(k))q.
3. build L hash tables according to g_i(q).
4. for a query, compute L hashing functions g_i(q), and get the final buckets.
5. calculate similarity (xcross) of p in final buckets and q that means query, and return top-K.
